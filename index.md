Welcome to my website. I am a sophomore at IIT Bombay pursuing an undergrad in Computer Science and Engineering.

This Blog mainly caters to provide me a platform to think and communicate my thoughts with you. That aside, Articles which are common to many many of my services are also posted here.

Now, I am mostly a Python and Web Developer with the occasional Android development (I hate *Java*!) and most of my projects are meant to solve real world problems. Some of them are [SourceSharer](http://www.sourcesharer.holes) which helps in sharing program code, [DynamicPython (Under Development)](http://www.dynamicpython.hol.es) which aims to simplify Python learning, [Notepad By Pradd]( http://geekpradd.github.io/Notepad-By-Pradd-/) which is a simple and concise Python based text editor. You can check out my [Profile](https://github.com/geekpradd/) on GitHub to get links to more of my Open Source Projects

## What I like

Well, In my free non coding time, I like reading books, be it related to Theoterical Physics or Mystery novels. And I really like watching Movies and TV Shows with *The Originals* and *Breaking Bad* being my favorite. Besides that, I study a lot as I aspire to crack IIT JEE which is one of the toughest entrance exams in the world.
