Highlighting Syntax in blogs created by Jekyll is actually very easy. You can use the Pygments syntax highlighter provided it's enabled in your YAML front-matter. Here is a demo highlight and below it is the code to do so:

{% highlight python linenos %}
def hey():
  print ("Ok!")

{% endhighlight %}

The sample code to do so:

<script src="http://www.sourcesharer.hol.es/view/embed/embed-x1MS.js"></script>

This was a pretty short post but It does it's job. See you later!
