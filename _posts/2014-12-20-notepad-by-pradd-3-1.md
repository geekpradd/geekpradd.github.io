Now many of you know that I have my very own Text (now Code) editor called Notepad By Pradd. It is coded in Python and uses Qt as it's GUI Library (Tk upto Version 2.3). Well, I've updated Notepad By Pradd to Version 3.1 today and it's awesome.

This update makes Notepad By Pradd more functional as a code editor and adds some features to the Text Editing Stack as well.

### Changes

These are the main changes:

PDF Support: Export, Open and Save files as PDFs
Markdown Support: Compile Markdown to HTML, and save Markdown files
Syntax Highlighting: For Python, C/C++, HTML5 and Markdown. More language support coming soon
Font bugs fixed. Support for future functionality of default editor added. New File function added (It was incomplete before)
Bug fixes and minor changes


So, now that it has syntax highlighting Notepad By Pradd can be used as a Code Editor. I'll soon be adding a Plugin System and probably Snippets.

### Download It

You can download the Setup for Windows from <a href="https://github.com/geekpradd/Notepad-By-Pradd-/releases/download/v3.1.0/Notepad.By.Pradd.Setup.exe"> this link </a>

Stay Tuned for more!
