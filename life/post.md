To Neha,

I'm not sure about what exactly I should write here. You wanted to know about the challenges that I face as a teenager. The problem is, if I start accounting each and every problem along with it's cause and reason it would be a very long letter. So I'll just write about some core problems that define me. That made me who I am right now.

But let me clarify. What kind of a person am I?
As you already know. I consider myself to be a geek. A modern geek. I'm in love with literature and binary and I also am intellectual in the sense that I can hold my own in any discussion. And I am not *that bad* socially.

From wikipedia,
> The word geek is a slang term originally used to describe eccentric or non-mainstream people; in current use, the word typically connotes an expert or enthusiast or a person obsessed with a hobby or intellectual pursuit 

So with that clear, let me start. And I will try to be completely honest in everything that I write.

##Early Beginnings 

I consider myself to be an average guy till the age of 10. This was the year 2010 and it was this year that I was able to gain admission in Army Public School Narengi. Before that I was in Faculty and except taking mental maths classes (which I aced) in ALOHA and reading encyclopedias for fun, I was an average child.

In the one year (2010-11) that I studied in APSN, I was able to form quite a network. I won competitions, ranging from Science Project to Debate to Quiz to Spell Bee. I made many friends, although I'm not in contact with any of them now.

So life was good. Examinations were unit test based and CCE was introduced that year so no pressure on the studies side. I became friends with some guys, who used to bully an Army kid. I used to laugh at him and even mock the kid. They used to do a prank and blame it on him. Even though I never bullied the kid, I was a spectator and I didn't do anything to stop him. I even used to jeer at a guy who was muslim and went on our bus along with this other friend of mine.

I so wish now that I didn't do that.

You see, the past has a odd habit of catching up to you when you least expect it. I guess Mother Nature repaid me a year almost 930 kms away. 

I'll come to that later. Actually, the thing is I don't remember much about my APSN life except the core details. I do remember reading a lot of car magazines and getting hooked to Digit magazine (a tech magazine which introduced me to the world of geekdom). I knew how to install Linux, format partitions, how hardware works, modding games, as well as how to overclock processors.

So I was already venturing into geek territory. But I still was social and not awkward.
But 4 years, did change me.

##Welcome to Hell

If I ever write a biography of my life, this section should be the one most highlighted.
Guess what? As you finish this letter, you will officially be the only person in the world who I know on a physical basis to know about this part (Another online friend helped me during the bullying phase). And that is why, I don't want this letter to be read by anyone else.

I feel that I can trust you regarding this, plus I need to let everything out. Even if I did just write this on my computer and not share it with anyone, It just won't have the same meaning.

So, you say that I am lucky. Because of the fact that I can live in multiple places and have different lives. Well you see, my situation is both a boon and a bane.

My dad works at Indian Oil, Marketing Division. We were transferred to Dhanbad, the coal capital of India. Consult this wikipedia link to know more about my home for 4 years. [Dhanbad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhanbad)

So I have vivid memories of hopping into that flight from Guwahati to Kolkata and then the train to Dhanbad. Despite the fact that Dhanbad has the same population as that of Guwahati and is filled with Mineral resources, due to a well developed railway system and low demand, the airport there is for only large freight purposes.

I'll skip the details now. I reached Dhanbad, stayed in a Hotel for 2 weeks, settled in into a 2 bedroom flat (Later on we'll move to a larger 3 BHK one but currently due to my Dad's rank we were assigned a 2 BHK).

And at the end of summer vacation, started my journey. One that would make me question everything. Make me stronger. As I say, I just stepped into hell.

##Oblivion 

> Oblivion: the state of being unaware or unconscious of what is happening around one 

I was in oblivion for an entire year. Unaware of the evil thoughts around me. 
This was Class 5. I really was an oblivious fool back then. Oblivious of what people thought of me. Oblivious of my surroundings.

Wrapping up quickly:
In Class 5, I ironically had a class teacher who had been to Assam who so that wasn't a problem. Everybody else, though, made me feel like an alien. 

Small Eyes + Straight Hair (it used to be very straight, like a porcupine) + fair complexion (4 years gave me a tanned look, but I was much more fairer than everyone else in the beginning) = Noticeable raised to the power infinity

Some teachers would ask me about my whereabouts, then comment like "I thought Assam is all jungle".
Some weren't that bad but would still make me feel different.

I was bullied by couple of Class 6 idiots in the bus. One of them was called Siddharth. Let me tell you Neha, if you think Tushar is bad, You should meet this guy. You'd just vomit. No sense of hygiene, looks like some escaped convict, is very fat, and has no sense of how to talk to people.

It wasn't even bihari hindi, it's something else. He is literally Tushar raised to the power infinity.

He bullied me. So did a couple of others. I learned to cope and didn't give much damn about it. Nicknames were developed. "Bora" and "Chinese" were the core ones. I used to sleep in the bus in the morning and these guys used to bother me a lot. A Class 5 guy used to wake me up and taunt me and well, it wasn't pleasant.

Ironically, the same guy sent me a "Miss You" sticker on hike (it's like WhatsApp). We actually became friends in class 8. 

Class 5 went by. I used to play on my building's terrace with some friends. There was this girl, who was the daughter of my dad's boss. I was instructed by my parents to be good with her and she and her mom were absolute bitches. They made my life hell. Her name is ["Dipabali Bandyopadhay"](https://www.facebook.com/dipabali.bandyopadhyay?fref=jewel). The link is to her facebook.

That is one of the reason why I'm bad with girls. She just ruined 2 years of my life. She was the complaining kind and whatever I did, or said, went to her mother, who complained to my mother. I once remember helping them out with their computer which had a resolution problem (My mother sent me). I just commented that the processor is kinda old for a new pc. And they thought I was bad mouthing their choice. Her mother scolded me, told my mother and the entire colony. 

As I say, girls are something that I just can't handle.

##Losing Innocence

Up to Class 6, I was an innocent kid. From Class 6 onwards, classmates started adulterating my mind. I realized the meanings of sex and everything else. It wasn't good exactly.

Bullying continued. Managed to learn to ignore them. Couple of Class 7-8 seniors went more extreme and went physical. Managed not to provoke them further because these were the gangbangers. 

Classmates were lackluster. Nobody there could understand me. They were all filled with useless faltu thoughts. No productive thoughts. All were maggus.

Some teachers were good, some were bad. Mostly bad. I knew more than almost all teachers. Some computer teachers were such that they probably never had dealt with a computer before.

Class 6 was spent gaming, and reading magazines.

Girls were all in their primetime. Had boyfriends, spent time digressing guys. I ignored all of them maintaining only necessary contact. I once remember accidentally bumping into a girl. They labeled me and called me rude things.

I diverged further into geekdom as a result. My computer and books could only understand me.

Oh, and one incident I should mention.
Class 5, I was a new student. I went out of my seat to submit my FA2 Project. Then suddenly, the sports teacher comes in. He was drunk. Child Violence wasn't illegal in that school and he decided to hit me. Bam. 5 tight slaps and a punch on the back. I cried like hell that day. Later on he apologized and said that "Dekho, tum seat se bahar aaye the toh mujhe gussa aa gaya. Baat aage mat badhao aur kisi ko bolna zaruri nahi hai"

I didn't do anything. That beating is something I'll never forget. 

I've always had a low self esteem. Still do. The reason is, I felt like a freak. Like someone different. I used to be so conscious of how weird I look, compared to all of them. Bad physical shape doesn't help either. I guess I should put that behind me but it's difficult. As I result, my mind was always bothered about what other's think of me. It's not good when you feel like shit.

Class 7, wings were changed. New teachers. Nobody knew me and I felt even worse. All seniors used to look at my face as if I was an abomination. Teachers were worser than before and I didn't learn much that year. Nothing of the Social Science course went into my head and I got numbers by memorizing. Science too was lackluster and my concepts weren't clear at all. Maths was better since I was natural at it and I could manage to solve parts of Class 8 NCERT by the end of Class 7.

##Falling in love.. with binary and geekdom

I guess I should dedicate parts to how I became a geek.
It all started with Digit magazine and I owe the editors of that magazine a lot. From programming, to designing, to general tech knowledge, to drooling over cars, to feeling excited looking at games, the magazine had me covered.

I started programming with QBASIC and HTML. I could grasp it but I started serious coding only in Class 8 learning Python, C++, Java, Haskell, PHP and working on many projects.

I watched a lot of Hollywood movies, come class 8. My exact free time memories of class 7 are a bit vague but I do remember reading lots of articles and books. 

I made some better friends. One of them was called Pranav. He was the only guy who I could relate with to a certain extent (around 30%). He watched Hollywood movies, was good at science and we had the same bus. But that's where the similarities end. He was around 5'10, had a good build and was dark. I was the exact opposite. But that didn't bother us and we became good friends [Please don't smirk and think of anything related to homosexuality. The guy has a girlfriend now].

By class 8, I made some online friends on this site called Quora. Quora changed me completely.
Before that, I used to think that I was very intelligent. I was wrong. Quora is a question answer site where you ask questions to get answers. You can read other people's questions and answers written by other people. I learnt a lot about life and became much more aware of the world.

Here is the link to my profile [Pradipta Bora - Quora](https://www.quora.com/Pradipta-Bora-1) on Quora.

I made online friends, worked on lots of programming projects. Made many websites and programs. You can check this link for my programming information (open source): [Pradipta Bora - geekpradd @github](http://github.com/geekpradd).

I got obsessed with Vampire Diaries and other TV Shows during class 8 but I still managed to study. I joined FIITJEE Dhanbad for coaching and learnt a lot of things and got addicted to Physics. Wikipedia + Khan Academy helped a lot too. 

##Exploration and Acceptance 

We traveled a lot during those 4 years. Different parts of India, different cultures. Bihar, UP, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Delhi, Rajasthan, I experienced all of them. Even though I did feel like I am being strictly observed in Bihar and UP, I still enjoyed the landscape and the ambiance.

I explored the world on my computer. I used to read anything and everything on Wikipedia that I could find, whether it be celebrity trivia to UN Security Council to Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty.

The problem stemmed from the fact that nobody ever cared about what was stored in my brains. There were some quizzers led by our maths teacher but they used to be limited to India. And frankly, I didn't give a fuck about India and it's mightiness.

I had to accept the fact that I was alone in this world. My parents couldn't understand me, still don't. Schoolmates were not upto my standards. I had to accept that I had nobody to share with, nobody to have fun with. You see, the guys that I was friends with, would never have the guts to bunk class, nor do antics that Mandeep does. Nor did they provide the opportunity to talk about things and people, like I do with you.

So I became kind of a loner. And so to survive, I started to put on masks. Pretension as they say.
I had to laugh at all those silly jokes about prostitutes, all those relationship drama between different people. I was degrading myself and was slowly losing control over myself.

I couldn't figure out who I was. Was I the innocent kid from APSN or the geek who writes lots of code or the studious jerk in school who had no standards in order to survive?

I didn't know and I still don't. And for that I am glad. Glad that I could leave that place, make friends here. Be more like the person that I am from the inside. And I am glad that I could talk to you about random topics whether it be Indian society, to careers, to movies. 

As Batman says
> It's not who you are underneath, it's what you do that defines you 

You know what, you cannot exactly blame me for not being social at the beginning, can you?
I'll tackle the parenting issue, then wrap up my hell stay, then finally come to my current problems.

##Parents: They'll never know 

My parents, what can I say about them. I love them a lot, they provided me the resources to be what I right now. But to be honest, everything that I have done, everything that I have achieved is solely because of my own hard work.

They had no clue about what was going on inside my thick skull all those 4 years. My mom was enjoying nature, writing poems, reading books, teaching students. She never really focused on me.

My dad was busy selling oil. Working hard tirelessly. My dad doesn't have any hobby or passion outside his job. He loves doing what he does and it pays well. I can't just complain now, can I?

The thing is, it's my mom that I have problems with. I love her the most but I just don't trust her. She acts like a control freak over things that I can manage and is oblivious to things that she could have helped me with. She wants full control over my online accounts but never worried about my school social life.

Did I ever tell you that I was afraid of my mom? Afraid of her expectations?

Once a couple of friends visited me. I didn't tell my mom and I didn't let them enter my house. The reason is, that I never had friends visit my house ever and she always shows that it would bother her.

I used to play cricket a lot. I made friends with some guys in the opposite apartment (this was during class 7). I never told her. Never went to any birthday party either.

Ah, birthday parties. From what I've gathered, you've celebrated your birthdays. Probably had fun too. Do you know when was the last time I celebrated my birthday? 2011. And that was the shittiest birthday party ever.

Kids from my apartment came. No friends. My sister was going through a gift phase and wanted this birthday to be treated as hers. She didn't even allow the kids to sing, "Happy Birthday Tonmon". She wanted it to be "Happy Birthday Joey". She created a ruckus. 

My dad wasn't present. Had to go to Gurgaon for training. It sucked even more. Next year, my mom said that since my dad wasn't there (This time went to Mumbai, for a high profile meeting) we won't celebrate my birthday. 2012. And this was 20th December 2012. The last day before the so called apocalypse.

I listened to music, ate chicken, played some games, hoping for something to happen. Never did.

Same situations with 2013 and 2014. No celebration, just food.

Every kid wants to have an awesome birthday. I never did. I promised myself last year, that in college, I'm going to party, get drunk and have some fun with a girl on my birthday.

Let's see how it goes (I don't think the girl part would apply; considering IITians == Bachelors).
[Read "==" as "exactly equals" (it's programming lingo)]

And expectations from parents. That is just insane. 
My mom wants the best from me. She just doesn't realize how difficult it is.

I had my all india coaching test recently. I told you that I got All India Rank 17. I never told her the result. The PTM was before the SST exam, and she just said this point blank: "There are 16 students ahead of you". We had a fight the day before. My mom and dad were going to Radisson Blue. A party organized by The Telegraph sponsored by Indian Oil. I was studying Economics and I was checking some notes on my dad's phone. I forgot to charge it.

She realized that there wasn't much charge left. She verbally lashed on me. My dad joined in to.
They said that I live in a dream world, shouted a lot. I cried after they left. This was despite the fact that he had a portable charger that he could use to charge his phone with.

I cried in the end in my coaching centre. It felt bad. I felt like I disappointed them.

Have they even seen the course that I have to put up with? Class 9 already is huge considering SST + IITJEE stuff which I enjoy. So it's not possible to be perfect in everything. But I guess they'll never realize that.

I don't trust my mom as such. She is very cunning and the fritzy type. Or atleast used to be.

That was about my parents. They'll never know what I love to do, what my passion is. My dad scolds me for using the computer, despite the fact that I have already studied. I cannot just keep on studying and studying can I?

You got your books to read, I like reading science fiction and mystery. My mom mostly has romantic novels. I'm not interested in them. So I read on my phone. Which is also another problem.

I also feel bad whenever I spend my parent's money. I mean, it's not like we are poor or anything. It's just that, I feel like I'm using someone else's money. He already spends so much on my education and study books. As a result, I don't buy other things even when he wants me to. I was scolded once for nothing going to shops for purchasing clothes. I wear a watch that is 3 years old and I cannot even fathom buying a 5000+ watch. I guess I just want to be financially independent.

I just want to imagine what they would do if they had a son like Mandeep or Snehanghsu. I guess our parents can be similar in that sense: they have no idea what a tough kid is and how to handle one.

##Goodbye Hell 

The month is April. The year is 2015. SA2 just got over and I was left to my devices. I was working on a cool simulation in the Python language.

I think the date was 4th. Not sure exactly. I went to bed and then my dad shouted "The transfer list is up!". We all woke up and went to him. There it was. PK Bora transferred from SM, Dhanbad DO to SDCSM, Guwahati DO. 

We were very tense because we had heard from external sources that we may not be transferred. Which would have been a problem since transfer in class 10 is difficult.

So I had a month to wrap things up. I had a variety of feelings. I was feeling nostalgic at leaving this place, which had become my home despite all odds. I called some friends, helped in packing. I met only Pranav before leaving and it wasn't nice. He was I think, my best friend and I felt kinda bad.

Fast forward 2 weeks. We woke up in the morning, went to the railway station. Boarded the Howrah Rajdhani Express. And there. Goodbye Dhanbad.

You think being transferred is awesome. Let me tell you a secret. It is both awesome and bad.

Being uprooted from a place where you had people you know, places you know isn't easy. But that isn't as bad as adjusting.

You feel adventurous when you walk down the airplane ramp. You look at the sky and immediately notice the subtle climate difference. You look around, you see different types of people. You see different languages.

It feels great, that moment. You realise that you have jumped from one phase of your life to another.

And then you get dragged down to reality. Housing. School. The two main problems that you have to tackle.

We stayed for 3 weeks in a guest house provided by the company. For school, we tried APSN and DPS. APSN and Maria's were done with the admission process and APSN was all full. DPS had an admission test which I gave and got selected.

Now the choice: try other schools which were nearby or go to DPS paying a bit more in terms of fees which is far away but sure to get a seat.

It's difficult. I once appeared for admission test of DPS in Class 4. My parents chose APSN over DPS because of distance.

But for once, I think, I am glad of choosing DPS.

The reason is that APSN is like DAV. Full of Bihari assholes. I didn't want that again in my life. Also, APSN doesn't have Sanskrit and I would have had to study Hindi instead. 
Maria would have been good too but admission was closed and it would have been a hassle.

So May comes and I walk through the doors of IX H.

Welcome to my new life.

##The Present and The Future

I have been having nasty dreams these days. It is mostly about the trisection of the Holy Trinity, the past, the present and the future. 

You see, my life is complex. I have multiple personalities, multiple timelines, multiple aspirations.

IITJEE is one of them. And so is Computer Science. But you know what, I never really enjoyed my life. Yes, the feeling that you get when your cool code compiles is something else but enjoyment with friends, I never experienced that.

That is until IX H.

What you are about to read now, is what I feel from the inside. I'm not really good at putting thoughts into words and so I'll just gradually try to explain my unsocial behaviour in the beginning. I had to think a lot and maybe this I would be able to explain now.

So how do I feel currently?

Well, firstly, I am thankful of the fact that I could make some friends. If I still had to sit behind Jonah, I guess I couldn't have made friends. Atleast not with you, Mandeep or Mrinank. I'll be frank, I'm bad at making the first move for friendship.

You see the day I entered the class, Tushar and Shahir started playing with me. When Tushar realised that I am from DAV, he became more friendly and he and Jonah were the first people to talk to me. Raghav was rude at first, I remember that. More than rude in fact. I've put that behind me.

Mrinank was good to me from the beginning and so was Jonah. They'll always be my good friends. Akhoury wasn't exactly that forthcoming. Obviously, when two people have the same buses, same class and live nearby, friendship is bound to happen but it took some time.

Mandeep was good to me quickly as well. The rest of the class, not so much. You, on the other hand, were difficult to figure out. Yes, I'll admit that that I did not say thank you to you the second day. I was still processing information. And maybe I did talk in monologues that day you first talked to me. The thing is, I don't trust people, especially those belonging to the fairer sex. My perception of girls was: Manipulative bitches. Obviously, you did prove me wrong but I wasn't wrong with my perception was I? (All girls excluding you).

So yes, I didn't open up to you and other people. It just isn't easy speaking from past experience. And coming to the statement that you said today, (that you could have helped me if I had asked) how was I supposed to know you were like all other girls that I had experienced before or like you actually are?

So first contact wasn't good. Still, I found Raghav, Jonah and Anurag to accompany me. 

Pratyush and Akhoury became good friends later on, after Summer Vacation. I still am not on good terms with everyone. Jishnu for instance, acts like as if I'm his worst enemy. People of other sections, I don't know many and I guess that's how it'll remain. Not that I care or anything.

I felt like shit at the beginning. Everybody has friends. Everybody is happy. Everybody knows everyone. I had no friends. I still was adjusting to the culture and attitude here. You could joke with your teachers easily, teachers act humane, violence is rare. And I'm mostly like everybody else. Not some abomination.

Adjusting with teachers isn't also easy. Obviously, I guess I have reached a sweet spot right now. I can talk to you, Pratyush and Akhoury and Raghav is better as well. Mandeep, Snehanghsu provide comic relief and Mrinank and Jonah are there always.

I had some issues in the coaching environment but I am all set right now.

So I guess that sums things up. I did not go into details about the bullying part and I think it should remain like that otherwise it'd be more nasty. 

So core problems: Alienation, lack of friendship, parenting, pretension, bullying.

I'm working on the above problems and things have improved I think coming here. Still am not satisfied with my life and happiness isn't there. I'm battling my subconscious in my dreams, handling my past and working for the future as well. 

Thanks for reading. Thanks for listening to me, helping me cope. I hope you were not bored with my sadness and dilemma. I hope to read your letter as well. (I guess that's the main idea in the end, sharing information about each other). And, if you want you can write your opinion in the box below and your comment will be sent as an email to my email id.

If you are wondering how I created this site, just some Javascript and HTML5. I won't go into details since you'd be bored.

Thanks a lot and bye.

Yours faithfully

Pradipta
